# odinProject-Library

Created a local functioning library app where books can be added as cards to the screen when the popup form is submitted. Classes were used to create a Book that could be easily constructed.
Learned to attach associate dom elements and their accompanied object together. Also used a dynamic grid to add books to document. Also allowed the option to delete a book and change its read status both on the browser and within the object.
